Reflection

Putting the idea on paper was super exciting, but the implementation was super challenging. Having math symbols on the system was a super challenging implementation. The choice of the backend language and the database is ultimately challenging; JavaScript wins. Additionally, integrating different APIs and ensuring seamless communication between frontend and backend required extensive debugging and testing. Managing user authentication, especially handling forgotten passwords securely, was another hurdle that took extra effort. Despite these challenges, seeing the project take shape and function as intended was incredibly rewarding. The experience has helped a little with my understanding of software development, testing, and deployment processes.
